        <h2>Sentiment Analysis Dataset</h2>
        
        <h3>Evaluation Reliability</h3>
        <p>
            Tagging text segments based on sentiment is largely subjective, as personal experiences,
            pre-existing perceptions, thoughts, and beliefs of the annotator influence it. Therefore,
            it is essential for the tagging instructions to be clear to ensure the annotators remain objective.
            We ensured that there were at least three different annotators,
            and in cases of disagreement among all three, more annotators were assigned.
            Annotators were instructed to assess sentiment from the writer's point of view.
        </p>
        
        <h3>General Information:</h3>
        <p>The database includes 30,000 sentences selected according to the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sentences are written spontaneously by humans. The sentences do not contain additional types of information 
                <br>
                (such as HTML, tables, images, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>The content of the sentences covers a variety of topics.</li>
            <li>The source of the information includes a combination of sentences and paragraphs.</li>
            <li>
                The sentences were written in the local dialect of Arabic, with most of the sentences written in the colloquial language commonly used 
                <br>
                on social networks.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sources:</h3>
        <p>The sentences were taken from two main sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tweets from Twitter: 20,000 tweets</li>
            <li>YouTube video comments: 10,000 comments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Corpus Domain Distribution:</h3>
        <p>The corpus contains sentences from various domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General content: 34%</li>
            <li>Sports: 12.8%</li>
            <li>Religious content: 28%</li>
            <li>Content with Religious Elements: 5.6%</li>

            <li>Content that cannot be categorized: 6.8%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diversity of Topics:</h3>
        <p>The texts were categorized into the following sentiment tags:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Expressing a positive or optimistic sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Expressing a critical, non-positive, or pessimistic sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> Sentences without strong positive or negative sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex:</strong> When the sentiment is unclear, ambiguous, or context-dependent.</li>
        </ul>
